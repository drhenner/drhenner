     Second, is to automate as much as possible.  Instead of hiring a new employees you should first be asking if a tech guy can automate the new employee's job.  
     Third is to build an awesome culture, similar to github and to have an awesome time building great stuff.  
     Fourth is to support open source projects.  
     Last but not least, always live by the rule that 'Best Idea wins', titles should not determine what idea is the best idea."
